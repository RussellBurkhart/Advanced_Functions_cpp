Searching and Sorting Arrays
As the manager of the credit card department for the Tidewater Credit Card Company, you are responsible for overseeing the daily operations. To facilitate the requests demanded of your department, you have decided to create a menu driven program that allows for searching account numbers and creating daily reports sorted on names and balances.
Create a flowchart before coding your program to help with the program design and development!
To test your program, use the sample data below. Create and initialize parallel arrays for each of the 3 fields.


Credit Card Number      Name            Current Balance
400692                Ross, Betsy           5677.54
285426                Duck, Donald          367.11
850273                Nella, Sam            45698.44
991482                Crockett, Dave        863.50
343410                Que, Susie            1010.36
731397                Deere, John           42.11
555286                Mossy, Mark           6331.00


Menu selections for the program should include the following. Multiple functions should be implemented all the code.
1. Search for a credit card number displaying the number, name and balance of the account. A message should be displayed for invalid numbers. 
2. Display all the accounts in alphabetical order in a neatly formatted report. All numeric values should be displayed to 2 decimal places. 
3. Display all the accounts in descending order by current balance. Use a different sorting routine than was implemented above. The output should again be in a report format with headings. Values should be aligned and numeric values should be displayed to 2 decimal places. 
4. Display the total of the balances owed by all the cusomers. 
5. Quit.
